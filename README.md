How does a changing environment impact political identity formation?

# Abstract

This project seeks to understand the impact of environmental marginalization on political identity formation. Many thoeries of identity formation argue that security threats (often threats to physical security, but in other areas this could include threats imposed by descriminatory infrustructure like immigration or justice systems) are the main mechanism through whcih politically salient identities such as ethnicity or race are formed. Here, I apply this logic to another form of institutional violence that is increasingly prominent in the modern era, environmental marginalization. A changing environment is at its heart a threat to the security of a group through their ability to access resources While issues like pollution and land degredation impact many groups, the costs of these are disproportunately felt by those who have the least access to power. Similarly to other security threats, this situation creates an in-group that is visibly more impacted than other groups in society, which should incentivise a stronger tie to the groups' salient political identities. In this dissertation project I will investigate this in 3 contexts: racial identity in the United States (Chapter 1), ethnic identity in Africa (Chapter 2), and class identity in Europe (Chapter 3).
