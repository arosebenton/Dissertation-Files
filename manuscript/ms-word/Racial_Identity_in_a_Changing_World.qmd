title: "Racial Identity in a Changing World: The Impacts of Environmental Degradation on Linked Fate"
abstract: "Environmental degradation is an inherently marginalizing experience. A growing body of evidence shows that people of color are more likely to live in areas that experience environmental degradation, are less likely to receive help with remediation and natural disaster relief, and what help they do receive is often condemned rhetorically by politicians and media. Despite a large body of literature denoting the importance of political identity on climate politics, little research examines the causal arrow in the opposite direction. I argue that the experience of local environmental degradation can impact the salience of group positionality in the larger political environment. That environmental degradation and other factors related to climate change are disproportionately felt by the marginalized is not a secret. Just as feelings of alienation due to immigration status make it easier for an individual to feel that their fate is intertwined with that of others in their racial or ethnic group, so too should situations such as pollution, lack of access to clean water, and poorer health outcomes when these events impact groups along racial and ethnic lines. Through use of a novel measure of environmental degradation (proximity to EPA Superfund National Priority List sites), this study investigates degradation impacts on racialized group dynamics in the United States."

It is imperative that political science reaches a more thorough
understanding of the impact that humans have had on the global
environment and the inevitable impacts that it will in turn have on
political behavior [@Roston2010]. Much literature has focused on the
impact of demographic information such as race, gender and sexuality on
belief in climate change, however little is known about the ways which
experience with related phenomena like pollution and other types of
environmental degradation might impact those same identities. This
research seeks to bridge that gap.
:::

While anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation are
existential threats to all humans and most geographic regions have been
degraded in a variety of ways, marginalized groups are the most
vulnerable due to issues of systemic inequality in political, economic,
and social contexts[@Nagel_2012]. Thus, an important question in
understanding this issue is its impact on the political behavior of
marginalized groups. I argue that when marginalized people experience
the externalities of a changing climate, such as increasing pollution,
land degradation, or natural disasters, the salience of their relative
group positionality in the larger political environment should become
more important to them through a stronger sense of racial linked fate.
Perceptions of power disparities and systemic injustice surround
environmentalist discourse in the broader political sphere, and so it
logically follows that the degradation of local ecosystems may trigger
the salience of racial identity. The following discussion will focus on
a few groups of literature: first, I will detail the ways in which the
effects of climate change and environmental degradation are dispersed
socially and demographically; then I will discuss patterns of research
in climate politics[^1] and where this theorization fits in context;
next I will illustrate the intertwined nature of identity and the
environment; then we will move on to a discussion of group consciousness
and linked fate as models of understanding racialized political behavior
in the United States; before pulling these disparate literatures into a
fleshed out theory of local environmental degradation and racial linked
fate.

[^1]: This implies a non-centered parameterization for the random
    effects which aids in the convergence of more complex hierarchical
    models [@McElreath2020, 446-471].

# Environmental Effects and Their Distribution

Environmental degradation is defined in varying ways, from very specific
definitions such as that of Li and Reuveny [-@LI_2006] which relies on
the presence and level of 5 indicators (carbon dioxide emissions,
nitrogen dioxide emissions, deforestation, land degradation, and organic
pollution in water) to more general and expansive definitions which
instead point to "a deterioration in environmental quality from ambient
concentrations of pollutants and other activities and processes such as
improper land use and natural disasters" [@OECD]. This paper will follow
the later definition and discuss environmental degradation as a broad
concept, understanding that this is a granular phenomena at best, which
adapts and takes new forma in new contexts. Part of the reason for this
is that climate change and environmental degradation are so
intrinsically linked. Climate change can drive land degradation and land
degradation makes the effects of climate change more impactful
[@Talukder_2021]. Is flooding more the fault of climate change for
changing the sea level or the degraded land that is missing its natural
protections from floods (such as plant cover, sand dunes, etc) because
of human interference? The answer is both; however, for the purposes of
doing science it is often easier to measure the direct impact of
environmental degradation on humans.

The main consequences that the United States will see from a changing
environment include both cyclical and permanent flooding of large
portions of the country, drought and water scarcity, crop failure, and
increased incidence and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes
and wildfires [@EPA_a; @Blankenship_2020]. Past the obvious risk of loss
of life and property damage, these effects are likely to drive migration
events, increase incidences of aggression, interpersonal violence and
crime, and to lessen the ability of national and state governments to
enforce rule of law [@Michael_1983; @Anderson_2000; @Tierney_2006;
@Stock_2007; @Piguet2011; @McLeman_2018]. These effects have the
potential for significant impact to political behavior, however it is
not the case that all people will experience the same type or level of
impact. Those who live in marginal areas will be impacted much more than
those who have the political clout to prevent pollution close to their
homes and workplaces (this is often called NIMBYism, meaning Not In My
Back Yard ism), the money to invest in mitigation measures, and better
access to relief measures after effects have started to be felt
[@Nagel_2012; @Muro2022; @Hill_1965; @Kramar_2018]. It follows then that
we should expect a range of outcomes when looking at how different
groups respond to degradation.

There are two angles by which we can understand the distribution of
human caused environmental changes: social and geopolitical. That is,
structural inequality has made it so that those with the least political
power are the most likely to bear the brunt of climate change and its
externalities, while the geographic component of the issue indicates
that certain regions and topographies will be more impacted more than
others [@Nagel_2012; @Muro2022; @Hill_1965; @Tomaskovic_Devey_1997;
@O_Connell_2012].

A growing body of evidence has shown that people of color are more
likely to live in areas that experience adverse outcomes from
environmental degradation such as drought and wildfire, are more likely
to experience pollution due to proximity to industrial areas, are less
likely to receive help from their leaders after natural disasters have
occurred, and what help they do receive is often condemned rhetorically
by politicians and media [@Nagel_2012; @Nixon2011; @Soyapi_2016]. This
is not surprising, because the similar arguments can be made about other
expressions of institutional violence, such as biased prison or
immigration systems. Due to this pattern, if the political behavior of
any group has been impacted by the environment it should be more obvious
in groups who are marginalized. Climate change cannot be fully
understood through the lens of the natural sciences because at a
fundamental level its impacts are tied to overarching structural
patterns of inequality and thus requires a wide body of
interdisciplinary research to be described properly.

# Climate Politics and Political Science

The study of climate change politics in Political Science, especially in
the American context, has been primarily focused on descriptive works
which detail the influence of identity on belief in or concern for
climate change, and on the individual, public opinion and electoral
outcomes brought on by various environmental factors [@Johnson_2005;
@Capstick_2014; @Achen2016; @Egan_2017; @Fielding_2016;
@Blankenship_2020; @Bechtel_2021; @Harth_2021; @Mackay_2021]. Natural
disasters and high temperatures in particular have been linked to
decreased government legitimacy, more critical appraisal of climate
mitigation measures taken by executives, voter turnout, and vote choice
[@Gomez_2007; @Healy2009; @Gasper_2011; @Carlin_2013;
@Blankenship_2020]. At an individual level, these variables are known to
heighten feelings of aggression and competition and to increase support
for expensive policy measures, hinting at an increasing level of risk
acceptance in respondents [@Anderson_2000; @Hazlett_2019].

The largest body of climate politics literature by far is that which
describes the impact of demographic variables on belief in or concern
for climate change; the two variables are highly correlated in American
public opinion, so I will use the concepts interchangeably [@Egan_2017].
As an issue which has been subject to heightened levels of
politicization and polarization over recent decades, it is not
surprising that political party and ideology are the strongest
predictors of climate concern[@McCright_2011; @Egan_2017]. Closely
following these are age, gender, and (more importantly for our purposes)
race, and socioeconomic status. As I will discuss in the next section,
the effects of climate change and environmental degradation are
disproportionately felt by marginalized racial groups, women, and those
of low socioeconomic status. This link between marginalization, climate
concern, and climate vulnerability serves as the foundation of this
theory of the environmental determinants of minority political behavior.

A tangential but possibly mitigating factor on the effect of the
environment on political behavior is issue salience. While this is a
highly polarized and highly politicized issue, it is also seen as a low
salience one with respondents regularly ranking it as one of the least
important issues on the public agenda, and it might even have decreased
in recent years [@Egan_2017; @Spisak_2022]. There is some hope for
younger generations, however the general public mood in America is that
climate change is something to fight over and have strong opinions
about, not something to take action over [@Egan_2017; @Tyson2021]. This
might indicate that even though certain groups are heavily impacted by
environmental factors they prioritize other issues. Nonetheless I argue
that climate impacts could be a spark that incentivizes a change in
feelings of racial identity by making plain the relative inequality
inherent in climate change. Although climate change is not one of
Americans' most salient issues, it may bring another issue into
heightened relief: identity politics. What is largely missing from the
literature is an in-depth analysis of the impacts of climate change and
environmental degradation on group behavior.

# Group Consciousness and Linked Fate

In this section, I narrow the conversation from a discussion of the
impact of environmental factors on broader political behavior to the
more specific question of its impacts on racial identity formation and
linked fate. As the above discussion shows, power politics and relative
group positionality are the main obstacles in the way of a more
equitable experience of climate change. A common way to overcome power
disparities throughout the world is racial and ethnic mobilization, a
mechanism by which groups of individuals with similar political
interests coalesce in order to combine their electoral and social power
[@Leighley2001a; @Fearon_2009; @Vermeersch2012]. Nagel [-@Nagel1997, 23]
argues that racial mobilization is a product of individuals partaking in
a "continuous assessment of situation and audience, emphasizing or
deemphasizing particular dimensions of ethnicity according to some
measure of utility or feasibility". As such, it is logical to
investigate the ways in which climate impacts racial identity formation
in particular.

One of the main frames of reference in which American politics
understands race is through group consciousness and linked fate. These
concepts build upon an understanding of race, not as an intrinsic,
primordial facet of humanity, but rather as something socially
constructed as a means of othering groups with various phenotypic
attributes. Omi and Winant [-@Omi2014a] discuss the formation of racial
identities through a historical framework, explaining how the importance
of identity politics and a history of White political strategies which
explicitly opposed the success of non-White groups has led to a
consistent power struggle in American politics. Because race impacts the
ways in which an individual experiences politics, it can also condition
the attitudes and behaviors that they adopt within political society.
Group consciousness is an understanding of one's identity in the context
of the relative group power disparities brought about by the racially
hierarchical nature of American society [@Omi2014a]. Linked fate, a
concept originally used to describe the impact of chattel slavery on
Black group consciousness, takes this one step further and articulates
an assumption that whatever happens to one person within a group will
impact the outcome of others and that what happens to the group will
influence the fate of individuals [@Dawson1995]. Dawson developed this
concept through reference to his Black Utility Heuristic, which
theorizes that their shared history has made race such an important
factor for Black Americans that their individual political behavior is
best understood when taking into account their relationship to the
group. This is the basis of the study of race and ethnicity by scholars
of American politics.

Two major developments in the theory of linked fate are relevant here.
First, works such as Sanchez and Masuoka [-@Sanchez2010] and Junn and
Masuoka [-@Junn2007] expand the idea of linked fate to other minority
groups and describe the potential for malleability in linked fate. Not
every Latino feels as if the political outcomes of Latinos as a group
will affect them, the importance of their racial identity can condition
the way in which that identity shapes their political attitudes and
behavior. The theoretically relevant mechanism here is marginalization,
because when groups who are excluded from society share experiences such
as systemic poverty, xenophobic public opinion, the impacts of
immigration on economic and social mobility, and possibly the
disproportionate allocation of climate change effects, they are more
likely to develop their group consciousness into a feeling of linked
fate due to frequent reminders of relative group positionality
[@Sanchez2010].

Second, further research made clear that the role of government policy
can be influential in the formation of racial identity. Junn
[-@Junn2007] discusses the ways in which decisions by the federal
government about which immigrants deemed acceptable and the ways in
which those decisions have changed over time has influenced the changing
racialized stereotypes for Asian Americans over time. Further, Silva et.
al [-@Silva_2020] show that less institutionalized government policies,
such as local police performance, can be racialized experiences that
shape public opinion along group-based lines. I would argue that climate
mitigation policies are experiences that trigger the salience of
relative group positionality because they operate as threats to group
security.

Security threats are a well known predictor of ethnic identity hardening
in comparative politics because they allow for the politicization of
group dynamics. By creating a group of insiders to which outside groups
are held up as strange and other, they begin to construct an identity
around this dynamic [@Lake1996]. This identity is malleable and changes
drastically over time as different factors raise the political salience
of ethnic identity and groups adapt to meet new challenges [@Barth1969;
@Weber1978; @Eller_1993; @Jesse2011 ] . Identity becomes instrumental as
elites within the community start to wield ethnicity as a political tool
with which to outbid each other, but can also be a symptom of
modernization and interaction with a more diverse, densely populated
city environment or some other change or shock to the standing context
of identity politics [@Bell1975; @Brass1996; @Jesse2011]. The key here
is that identity is context dependent and adaptive, indicating that
major shocks like environmental change should precipitate some sort of
change in the strength of political identity.

That environmental degradation and other factors related to climate
change are disproportionately felt by the marginalized is not a secret.
Just as feelings of alienation due to immigration status make it easier
for an individual to feel that their fate is intertwined with that of
others in their racial or ethnic group, so too should situations of
disproportionate allocation of pollution and other types of
environmental degradation when these events impact them along racial and
ethnic lines.

::: {custom-style="Hypothesis"}
*Hypothesis 1 (H~1~)*: The reported levels of linked fate for minority
respondents will be impacted by their experience of degraded local
environments.
:::

In practical terms, I can see two plausible pathways for this
relationship, which I will term the low visibility model and the high
visibility model. Under the low visibility model the community in
question does not recognize when the local environment has been degraded
and as such their levels of linked fate are not impacted. However, some
actor (such as the state government, an individual who does not
broadcast their actions to the larger community, etc.) contacts the EPA
and begins the decision process to name the contamination zone an EPA
Superfund site. Once that process concludes the site will either be
approved or denied. If the site is denied in the low visibility model, I
expect no change in reported levels of linked fate. The people living
near the site did not notice the instigating degradation event and a
denied site does not receive the visibility boost that an approved one
has, so they would continue to live their lives as usual. In the
counterfactual in which the same site was approved by the EPA and thus
received the accompanying signage, fences, and other visible indicators
that some pollutant exists in the area, I expect linked fate would
increase. Respondents who were previously unaware of the site would not
necessarily see site approval as a relief from concerns brought to the
government, because they were not aware that a problem existed in the
first place. However, community members who are naive to the impact of
environmental degradation in their local area who suddenly come upon an
EPA Superfund site would likely be shocked and have cause to contemplate
how and why the degradation happened in the first place. Thus, the only
way for linked fate to go is up.

![](images/canva_theory.png)

Under the high visibility model, I expect that an approved site will
lower levels of linked fate for a similar reason. A community who has
brought concerns about local environmental degradation to the federal
government and then sees action from the EPA, in the form of site
approval, has had their concerns addressed. Linked fate is in many ways
an expression of the way a respondent sees the way they are treated by
the government. If the government is responsive, linked fate should
decrease. Finally, a denied Superfund site should increase linked fate.
A community has expressed distress about environmental degradation and
has been ignored, which would likely drive perceptions of adverse
treatment by the government. The data currently available for this
analysis include only approved sites, so this analysis will look only at
(1) if change in proximity to approved sites over time impacts at all,
and (2) which direction that change is in [^2].

[^2]: Centroids and proximity are calculated via the sf package in R
    (Pebesma et al 2022).

# Data and Operationalization

## Dependent Variable

The outcome of interest in this study, *linked fate*, is operationalized
as a question from the 2016 and 2020 waves of the American National
Elections Survey. The questions ask each racial group (Black, Hispanic,
and Asian) "How much do you think that what happens generally to
\[racial group\] people in this country will affect what happens in your
life?" The ordinal factor is restructured so that it increases as the
level of linked fate increases: "Not at all" (0), "Not very much" (1),
"Some" (2), and "A lot" (3). The location for the 2,317 observations is
coded as the geographic center point for their legislative district.
This is the lowest geographic level available for the respondents.

## Independent Variables

The main predictor in this analysis is proximity to EPA Superfund
National Priorities List Sites. This is a program established by the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of
1980 (CERCLA), generally referred to as the EPA "Superfund"
program/project. This is a novel predictor as of yet in political
science as far as I can tell, but I would argue that it is more
appropriate here than the commonly used measures (generally the levels
of one or more specific pollutants in the air or water) because measures
of any given pollutant are hardly a holistic measure of the entire local
system. Knowing the levels of ozone in an area might be helpful in
certain questions, but on their own their use in this study would not
give us a good picture of the conditions that respondents live with due
to long term challenges in the quality and reach of information about
local pollutants[@Ramirez2019] and the generally low level of issue
salience associated with climate topics [@Egan_2017; @Spisak_2022].

By measuring proximity to a source of environmental degradation, we can
more clearly connect the issue with a respondents daily life and, more
importantly, Superfund sites are extremely visible as can be explained
best through a narrative of the process each site (ideally) will go
through. The life cycle of an EPA NPL listed site begins when a
community realizes that there has been some event which has caused the
area to be degraded, usually through pollution by some contaminant. The
site is brought to the attention of the EPA and is given a preliminary
assessment inspection, where an employee of the EPA surveys the site and
determines if the report is viable for continued investigation. Then, a
more detailed assessment leads to a review process during which a site
is approved if it meets one or more of the following requirements:

● A score of 28.50 or higher on the Hazard Ranking System (HRS); a
scoring instrument used by the EPA to quantify information collected
during the various inspection phases.

● EPA determination that the site is a significant threat to public
health

● EPA determination that remediation (an authority limited to NPL sites)
will be more cost-effective than emergency removal (a more accessible
tactic)

● Top Priority designation by a State or Territory government

● Recommendation by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(a sister agency also established by the CERCLA/Superfund legislation)

The key part of this process to its viability as a variable in this
analysis is community recognition of the site. Since their recognition
of the site is necessary for it to be noticed by the EPA, and due to the
visibility of established sites (see Appendix 1), we can assume that
most respondents would recognize that they live near or directly in a
contaminated area.

![](npl_map.jpg){fig-align="center"}

NPL proximity is measured in two ways. I utilize the lowest level of
geocoding available for ANES respondents, legislative districts, to
narrow down their location. I take the geographic center points of each
district and calculate the distance to all NPL sites in the
corresponding state [^3]. The measure *proximity* is the mean distance
for that respondent, which has been logged to account for skewness.
Second, *In District* is a simple dichotomous variable indicating if
there are any sites in that legislative district. Finally, I include a
control for the average *HRS score* for all sites within the state in
order to account for the impact that site severity might have on
perceptions of pollution in the area.

[^3]: Centroids and proximity are calculated via the sf package in R
    (Pebesma et al 2022).

![](images/prox_dist.jpg)

I also include additional respondent-level demographic predictors from
the ANES which might influence survey sampling. *Age* is a 7
level-factor ranging from "18-24" to "65+"; *female* is a dichotomous
measure of gender with male as the reference category; and *race* is a 3
level nominal factor with the levels "Asian American", "Black or African
American", and "Hispanic or Latino", which are the only groups that are
targeted for this question. Finally, I include a control for which
*census region* the respondent lives in, under the assumption that the
context of racial identity varies across region meaning that states,
say, in the South are not comparable to those in the West, Midwest, or
Northeast, and a dichotomous measure of *time,* indicating which wave of
the ANES the observation is from. Descriptive statistics for all of the
variables in the model can be found in Appendix 3.

# Method

To evaluate the theoretical expectations outlined in the preceding
section, I estimate a series of Bayesian hierarchical categorical logit
models. In the context of the observed data in which respondents
$i \in \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ are nested within congressional districts
$j \in \{1,2,\dots,J\}$ which are in turn nested within states
$s \in \{1,2,\dots,S\}$, the model can be expressed as a set of
equations representing each level.

$$
\begin{align}\
y_{ijs} &\sim \mathrm{Categorical}(\theta_{k})\\
\mathrm{logit}(\theta_{k}) &= \alpha_{js,k} + \beta_{1s,k}\mathrm{Time}_{k} + \beta_{2,k}x_{2,k} + \dots + \beta_{l,k}x_{l,k}\
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-population-level}

::: a
Equation @eq-population-level represents the population-level effects,
where the relative probability of the response $\theta_{k}$ for each
category $k \in \{1,\dots,K\}$ is a function of a global intercept
$\alpha$, a set of $L$ fixed coefficients $\beta_{l}$ which capture
respondent-level demographic characteristics, a dichotomous indicator
for survey wave that takes value of 0 for the 2016 ANES wave and 1 for
the 2020 wave, and an interaction between time and average log proximity
to an EPA Superfund site from the center point of a respondent's
congressional district, and a control for the average severity of those
sites. The varying intercepts, denoted $\alpha_{j,k}$ and $\alpha_{s,k}$
capture congressional district and state specific deviations from the
global average for the $k^{th}$ category respectively.
:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_{j[s],k} &\sim \mathcal{MVN}(\gamma_{10} + \gamma_{11}z_{11} + \dots + \gamma_{14}z_{14}, ~ \sigma_{\alpha_{j[s],k}})\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-district-level}

::: a
At the congressional district level shown in equation
@eq-district-level, the district-by-state intercepts for each category
$k$ follow a multivariate normal distribution whose mean is a linear
combination of the overall average within congressional districts
$\gamma_{10}$ and a series of coefficients for census regions
$\gamma_{l}z_{l}$ that help structure the district-level effects which
varying intercepts capture congressional district deviations from the
overall state-specific average. The hierarchical standard deviations,
$\sigma_{\alpha_{sj,k}}$ are sampled from a moderately regularizing
hyperprior from an exponential distribution such that
$\sigma_{\alpha_{sj,k}} \sim \mathrm{Exponential(\lambda)}$ where
$\lambda = 1.5$.[^4]

    effects which aids in the convergence of more complex hierarchical

Finally, equation @eq-state-level represents the state level effects.
The state-specific intercepts $\alpha_{s}$ and varying coefficient for
time $\beta_{1s,k}$ are assumed to follow a multivariate normal
distribution whose mean is a function of the baseline relative log odds
of each category $k$ and survey wave specific deviations from the
baseline across states. The covariance matrix $\Sigma$ can be decomposed
into a correlation matrix $\Omega$ and a vector of scales $\tau$ and
reparameterized as the result of a Cholesky factorization such that
$\Sigma = \mathrm{Diag}(\tau) \,\Omega\, \mathrm{Diag}(\tau)$ as shown
in equation @eq-state-covariances below [@Gelman2014a, 367-378].

The correlation matrix $\Omega$ is then assigned a multivariate prior
from an LKJ distribution of the form $\Omega \sim \mathcal{LKJ}(\xi)$
where $\xi = 5$, placing moderate constraints on the correlation between
the state-level time slopes and intercepts [@Lewandowski2009]. For the
vector of scales $\tau$, I assign a moderately regularizing exponential
prior with $\lambda = 1$, allowing for slightly larger differences
between states compared to congressional districts within states.

I estimate the model via the probabilistic programming language Stan
(relying on the CmdStanR interface, a lightweight alternative to brms)
which implements the No-U-Turn sampler variant of Hamiltonian Markov
Chain Monte Carlo [@Carpenter2017; @Hoffman2014]. I run six Markov
chains in parallel for 5,000 iterations each. The first 3,000 iterations
for each chain are discarded after the initial warm-up adaptation stage
leaving us with 12,000 posterior samples for subsequent analysis [^5].
Posterior predictive checks (Appendix 2: Figure 3) indicate that this
model predicts a distribution that is very close to that of the sample
data [@Gelman2014a; @Gelman2007].

[^5]: Estimation is performed under R version 4.2.1 using the brms
    package (Bürkner 2017, 2018; R Core Team 2021), which serves as a
    front-end for regression models using Stan's implementation of
    Hamiltonian Markov Chain MonteCarlo.

# Results

The results of this analysis indicate that change in proximity to EPA
Superfund locations does indeed impact levels of linked fate. Figure 4
shows the change in probability for each of the potential outcomes when
jointly manipulating both *time* and *proximity*; more plainly, the
change in probability of each response if every respondent increased x
units in *proximity* between 2016 and 2020. Importantly, Figure 4
presents Bayesian credible intervals which are predictions of the
expected population distribution rather than confidence intervals which
estimate a feasible range for the parameter. Recall, *proximity* is
modeled as the logged mean distance to all Superfund sites in a given
state. As we can see in Figure 4, as the *proximity* term increases
respondents are less likely to respond "Not a lot" to the linked fate
question and more likely to respond "A lot". So, as respondents get
farther away on average from cleanup sites their level of linked fate
increases.

I interpret this to mean that being near visible signs of the government
intervening to cleanup dangerous materials may be a similar mechanism to
institutionalized racism, in that the actions of the government (EPA
clean up, police misconduct, etc) send a signal to marginalized groups
of their value to that entity and either reinforce or counteract those
groups understandings of their relative positionality in the political
culture of that area. If the government acts to protects a marginalized
group in the same way that they would have protected a more privileged
group, marginalized people will have less reason to believe that
racialized systems of inequality have impacted them due to their group
identity.

# Conclusion

This analysis attempts to bridge the bodies of literature surrounding
climate politics and minority political behavior. I argue that because
structural inequality is so tightly linked to the impacts of
environmental degradation, environmental degradation should have an
impact on the political behavior of racially and ethnically marginalized
groups. As environmental degradation makes climate politics a more
impactful facet of human life, perceptions of group positionality and
systemic environmental inequality will incentivize marginalized groups
in affected areas to identify more strongly with their ethnic or racial
identity and thus report a higher level of linked fate. Just as social
identity influences environmental attitudes, so too should climate
change influence identity and group consciousness. I find that over
time, respondents who live closer to EPA Superfund cleanup sites have
lower levels of linked fate, indicating that government aid in
mitigating the impacts of environmental racism are likely to positively
impact the way that minority groups view their relationship with the
government and broader society. This research is limited in a few ways.
Most notably, the measure that I use for proximity to EPA Superfund
sites is flawed in that the ANES does not geocode their responses. As
such, the closest estimate that I am able to use for the locations of
each respondent relies on their legislative district. While center
points of legislative districts allows for some variation in the
proximity measure, ideally, I would be using the exact location, or
something closer to city or county level geocoding. Secondly, this time
series only utilizes 2 waves of the ANES. I would prefer to have a
longer time series, however the linked fate question on the ANES has
only been asked two times. The only alternative large scale political
survey which might be a better alternative is the Collaborative
Multiracial Post-Election Survey. While the CMPS is infinitely
preferable to the ANES in terms of sample size (the CMPS oversamples
Black, Asian, and Hispanic respondents and thus has an N 3x the size of
the ANES for the linked fate question, which is only asked to those
groups), the linked fate question changed significantly between the 2016
and 2020 waves, and as such is not comparable. So, for now, the two
waves of the ANES is the better option of the two. Despite these
limitations, these results are promising for scholars of climate
politics and of racial and ethnic dynamics in the United States. The
analysis is evidence that while marginalization and climate politics are
intertwined, efforts on behalf of the government can mitigate the
adverse effects of human centered changes to local ecosystems.
